    "# Exact and noisy simulation with Qiskit Aer primitives\n",
    "\n",
    "[Exact simulation with Qiskit primitives](simulate-with-qiskit-primitives) demonstrates how to use the reference primitives included with Qiskit to perform exact simulation of quantum circuits. Currently existing quantum processors suffer from errors, or noise, so the results of an exact simulation do not necessarily reflect the results you would expect when running circuits on real hardware. While the reference primitives in Qiskit do not support modeling noise, [Qiskit Aer](https://qiskit.org/ecosystem/aer/) includes implementations of the primitives that do support modeling noise. Qiskit Aer is a high-performance quantum circuit simulator that you can use in place of the reference primitives for better performance and more features. It is part of the [Qiskit Ecosystem](https://qiskit.github.io/ecosystem/). In this article, we demonstrate the use of Qiskit Aer primitives for exact and noisy simulation.\n",

After $m$ applications of the depolarizing channel, the probability of the state being preserved would be $(1 - p)^m$. Therefore, we expect the probability of retaining the correct state at the end of the simulation to go down exponentially with the number of CX gates in our circuit.\n",

It is a conservative estimate because it does not take into account the initial state of the simulation.

When running the Sampler, we pass `shots=None` to request a final distribution that does not include random sampling error.\n"
